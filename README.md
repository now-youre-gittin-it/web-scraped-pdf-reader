# web-scraped-pdf-reader
Retrieving the PDF from a web link and parsing through the file to read and store the text within the PDF file.
The text is read using the fitz library. 
Note that there is no need for OCR on the PDF here because it already contains machine-readable text. This code won't work on files that need OCR to obtain readable text.
Note: the PDF file from the link is solely the property of the original owners; this is a learning exercise.
